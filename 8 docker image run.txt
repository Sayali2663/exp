Docker is an Open source containerization platform.
It enables developers to package applications into containers—standardized executable
components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) 
libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.
Containers simplify delivery of distributed applications and have become 
increasingly popular as organizations shift to cloud-native development 
and hybrid multi cloud environments.
