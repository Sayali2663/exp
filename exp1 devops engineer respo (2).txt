Aim:- To understand DevOps: Principles, Practices, and DevOps Engineer Role
and Responsibilities.

Theory:-
What is DevOps?
DevOps stands for development and operations. It’s a practice that aims at merging
development, quality assurance, and operations (deployment and integration) into a
single, continuous set of processes. This methodology is a natural extension of Agile
and continuous delivery approaches.

DevOps principles:-
Constant collaboration and communication:- These have been the building blocks of DevOps since its dawn. 
Your team should work cohesively with the understanding of the needs and expectations of all members.
Gradual changes:- The implementation of gradual rollouts allows delivery teams to release a product to 
users while having an opportunity to make updates and roll back if something goes wrong.
Shared end-to-end responsibility:- When every member of a team moves towards one goal and is equally 
responsible for a project from beginning to end, they work cohesively and look for ways of facilitating other members’ tasks
Early problem-solving:- DevOps requires that tasks be performed as early in the project lifecycle as possible. 
So, in case of any issues, they will be addressed more quickly.

DevOps Practices:- 
Agile planning:- In contrast to traditional approaches of project management, Agile planning organizes work in short 
iterations (e.g. sprints) to increase the number of releases. 
Continuous development:- The concept of continuous “everything” embraces continuous or iterative software development,
 meaning that all the development work is divided into small portions for better and faster production. 
Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD):- The code that passes automated tests is integrated in a single, 
shared repository on a server. 
Continuous deployment:- At this stage, the code is deployed to run in production on a public server. 
Continuous monitoring:- The final stage of the DevOps lifecycle is oriented to the assessment of the whole cycle. 
The goal of monitoring is detecting the problematic areas of a process and analyzing the feedback from the team and users to 
report existing inaccuracies and improve the product’s functioning.
Infrastructure as a code:- Infrastructure as a code (IaC) is an infrastructure management approach that makes continuous delivery 
and DevOps possible. 
A DevOps Engineer: role and responsibilities
So, the title of a DevOps Engineer is an arguable one. Nonetheless, DevOps engineers are still in demand on the IT labor market. 
Some consider this person to be either a system administrator who knows how to code or a developer with a system administrator’s skills.

DevOps engineer responsibilities
In a way, both definitions are fair. The main function of a DevOps engineer is to introduce the continuous delivery and continuous integration workflow, 
which requires the understanding of the mentioned tools and the knowledge of several programming languages.
Depending on the organization, job descriptions differ. Smaller businesses look for engineers with broader skillsets and responsibilities. 

DevOps Engineer Role and Requirements:-
The basic and widely-accepted responsibilities of a DevOps engineer are:
Writing specifications and documentation for the server-side features
Continuous deployment and continuous integration (CI/CD) management
Performance assessment and monitoring
Infrastructure management
Cloud deployment and management
Assistance with DevOps culture adoption
Additionally, a DevOps engineer can be responsible for IT infrastructure maintenance and management, which comprises hardware, 
software, network, storages, virtual and remote assets, and control over cloud data storage


Conclusion:- We are able to understand DevOps: Principles, Practices, and DevOps Engineer Role and Responsibilities.
